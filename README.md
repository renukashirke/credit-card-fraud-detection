# Credit Card Fraud Detection Project

## Introduction

Credit card fraud is a pressing concern within the financial industry, demanding rigorous attention. The paramount objective of this project is to employ data-driven methodologies to effectively identify and mitigate fraudulent transactions, thereby safeguarding the interests of credit cardholders and financial institutions.

## Understanding Credit Card Fraud

Credit card fraud is the unlawful utilization of a credit card, whether through a stolen physical card or the illicit use of card information, to engage in unauthorized financial transactions. These activities occur without the cardholder's knowledge or consent and pose a substantial threat to financial security.

## The Dataset

This project draws from a real-world dataset available on Kaggle, encompassing credit card transactions executed by European cardholders in September 2013. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for the comprehensive analysis of credit card fraud detection.

### Dataset Overview
The dataset can be accessed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/priyang/credit-card-fraud-detect-under-over-sampling).

- Spanning two days, it comprises 284,807 transactions, of which 492 transactions are fraudulent. Notably, the instances of fraudulent transactions represent a mere 0.172% of the total dataset, underscoring the challenge of identifying them.

- The dataset is populated with numerical features derived from Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Regrettably, due to confidentiality constraints, the specific attributes and background details remain undisclosed.

- The features designated as V1 through V28 represent principal components obtained through PCA, while the 'Time' feature signifies the time elapsed since the first transaction. The 'Amount' feature reflects the transaction value. The 'Class' attribute is of paramount significance, assuming a value of 1 for fraudulent transactions and 0 for legitimate ones.

## Project Objectives

This project aspires to deploy advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques to uncover patterns and anomalies inherent in the dataset. The ultimate goal is the construction of a robust credit card fraud detection model.

By harnessing the potential of this dataset, we aim to scrutinize its features comprehensively and apply diverse machine learning algorithms to enhance fraud detection while minimizing false positives, thereby fortifying the security of credit card transactions.
